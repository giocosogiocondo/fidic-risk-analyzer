    "Contract based on FIDIC 1999 Red Book for airport runway works in Gibraltar",

  "errors_identified": [
    "Contractor failed to establish unforeseeable ground conditions within FIDIC 4.12 definition",
    "Insufficient contemporaneous evidence to support claims",
    "Court held burden of proof firmly on Contractor",
    "Employer’s delay in possession not sufficient to excuse Contractor’s wider failures",
    "Contractor’s approach to EOT and variations found procedurally and substantively deficient"

    "Termination under FIDIC 15.2 requires careful procedural compliance but will be upheld if properly executed",
    "Variation claims must be precisely documented and causally linked to cost/time impacts"
